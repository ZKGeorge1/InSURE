# InSURE
Data security and insurance fraud are significant challenges in the health insurance industry, leading to breaches of patient information and financial losses. Insurance providers store vast amounts of medical data, making them vulnerable to leaks and compromising patient trust. Fraudulent claims further strain resources and increase premiums, costing the healthcare industry billions of dollars annually. 

InSURE is a zkApp designed to address these challenges by establishing a trustless system between patient and provider.
